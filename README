Tgmpv is a telegram bot for playing videos to a running mpv instance over it's IPC socket.

mpv can be started to use the IPC socket like this:
mpv --idle --input-unix-socket=/tmp/mpv_socket --keep-open=yes

Due to the nature of telegram bots, there are ways of restricting the access to play content to mpv.
tgmpv can take a -users flag which is a comma seperated list of telegram usernamse that are allowed to play
as well as -group which whitelists a single group ID for use. If both of these are defined then the bot
checks both values for authorization. If neither is supplied then there is no checks made.

The library may be defined with the -lib flag. This is used in the /list and /listi commands.

The bot token must be defined with the BOTTOKEN enviornment variable.

Commands:
/list <search string>:		Searches the library folder for files that optionally match the search query. The resulted in returned to the user.
				The results are printed alongside index numbers, the numbers may be used in substitute of the file names
				for the /listi and /playi commands.
/listi <index> <search string>:	List the subfolder of the library based on the index of the previous list operation.

/play url-or-filename:		Loads the file in to mpv through the use of the loadfile IPC command.
/playi:				Loads the file identified by the index of the last list operation in to MPV.

Example:
BOTTOKEN=<token> ./tgmpv -users myusername -lib $HOME/videos

A call to /list will list all of the files and folders in the library directory.
A subsequent call to /listi 0 will list the contents of the first result assuming it is a folder.
A subsequent call to /playi 0 will play the first file found in the subfolder.
